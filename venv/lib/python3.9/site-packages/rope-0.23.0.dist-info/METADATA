 rope -- the world's most advanced open source Python refactoring library
=========================================================================


Overview
========

`Rope`_ is the world's most advanced open source Python refactoring library
(yes, I totally stole that tagline from Postgres).

.. _`rope`: https://github.com/python-rope/rope


Most Python syntax from Python 2.7 up to Python 3.10 is supported. Please file bugs and contribute
patches if you encounter gaps.

Getting Started
===============

* `How to use Rope in my IDE or Text editor? <https://github.com/python-rope/rope/wiki/How-to-use-Rope-in-my-IDE-or-Text-editor%3F>`_
* `List of features <docs/rope.rst>`_
* `Overview of some of rope's features <docs/overview.rst>`_
* `Using as a library <docs/library.rst>`_
* `Contributing <docs/contributing.rst>`_

To change your project preferences edit
``$PROJECT_ROOT/.ropeproject/config.py`` where ``$PROJECT_ROOT`` is
the root folder of your project (this file is created the first time
you open a project).


Why use Rope?
=============

- Rope aims to provide powerful and safe refactoring
- Rope is light on dependency, Rope only depends on Python itself
- Unlike PyRight or PyLance, Rope does not depend on Node.js
- Unlike PyLance or PyCharm, Rope is open source.
- Unlike PyRight and PyLance, Rope is written in Python itself, so if you experience problems, you would be able to debug and hack it yourself in a language that you are already familiar with
- In comparison to Jedi, Rope is focused on refactoring. While Jedi provides some basic refactoring capabilities, Rope supports many more advanced refactoring operations and options that Jedi does not.

Bug Reports
===========
